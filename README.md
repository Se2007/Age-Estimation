## Introduction

Age estimation in the wild is a highly challenging task, given the variability in conditions, pose complexities, image quality variations, and the presence of partially or completely occluded faces. This project provides solutions to tackle these challenges using three distinct methods.

## Methods

### 1. MiVolo (Multi Input Volo)

MiVolo is a method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in age estimation. It leverages a multi-input Volo architecture to address the complexities of age estimation in real-world scenarios.

### 2. ResNet-Based Approach

In this method, a ResNet-based architecture is used for the body of the neural network and the classification head. This approach combines the power of ResNet with age estimation.

### 3. Multi Input GhostFaceNet

The Multi Input GhostFaceNet method incorporates ghost blocks with multiple inputs from both the face and body. This unique approach aims to enhance the accuracy of age estimation in challenging conditions.
